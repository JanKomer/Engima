# Engima
An enigma machine coded in Java, for the purposes of private communication through letters with valued persons.

The machine needs a setup upon each use, though the process is streamlined and simple.
User needs to enter a set of swapped letters, which are then swapped in the Plugboard of the machine. This needs to be one row of pairs of letters, separated by single spaces.
Next, a message Key is needed. It's used for the initial setup of the machine's Rotors. It's supposed to be a three letter String.
Lastly, a Ring offset is needed, used for changing the position of the Rotor notches. Use 3 numbers in a line for input, between 1-26. Again, separated by single spaces.
After that, user can input as many messages as they want. Messages that need to be deciphered are written in the same place as ones waiting enciphering.
Note: Only English alphabet letters are allowed, as well as spaces, commas, exclamation mark, question marks and periods. ( .,!?)
Happy spying! :)
